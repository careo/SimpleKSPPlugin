# SimpleKSPPlugin

Authors:

## Setup

You need to setup a couple of shortcuts / symlinks:
  
  * `Library/KSP` -- the directory with the DLLs shipped with KSP. On OS X this is `<kspdir>/KSP.app/Contents/Data/Managed/`, and on Windows this is `<kspdir>/KSP_data/Managed`.
  * `Build/Plugins` --  wherever you want your compiled DLL. I have it pointing to the `Plugins` directory of a "lite" version of KSP I use for development.



## Contributors

 * cybutek <admin@cybutek.net> for the initial PartModule boilerplate that got this all started!
